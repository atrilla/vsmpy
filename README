VSMpy
=====

VSMpy is a bare bones Python package implementing a standard Vector Space
Model (i.e., binary-valued vectors from a Bag-Of-Words language model 
compared with the cosine similarity measure) in the context of a ready-to-
distribute package. It illustrates:

* package and module structure
* configuration for build and installation
* running scripts for testing

In the end, this is almost the same as Bob Carpenter's (Alias-i, Inc)
"pyhi" project skeletal distribution (see 
http://alias-i.com/python/pyhi/) with a veneer of Text Classification.
